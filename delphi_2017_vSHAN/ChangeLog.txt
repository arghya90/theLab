  - r01   chuan   2013July01   The 1st reversion in SVN.
  - r02   chuan   2013Nov25    1. Updated reading size and charge files in IO class.
                               2. Updated excel file. \n
  - r03   chuan   2013Dec04    1. Completed reading/writing PDB file in IO class.
                               2. Completed assigning size and charge to atoms. \n
  - r04   chuan   2013Dec05    fixed bugs in IO class.
  - r05   chuan   2013Dec10    major changes in prototypes, delphi, main and misc.
  - r06   chuan   2013Dec13    overhauled the subsystems of prototypes, delphi, misc, io.
                               1. Now the part of code before surface construction is completed.
                               2. Now the code requires GCC 4.3+ with option std=c++0x to compile due to the additional feature of
                               initializing values when creating large arrays. (see comments in makefile)
  - r07   chuan   2013Dec24    Another set of major changes includes:
                               1. Converted map<string,void *> to map<string,boost::any>
                               2. Converted all regular and dynamically allocated multi-dimensional arrays to 1D stl::vector<T> in the map. \n
                               The reasons to do so are: 1) contiguous memory allocation. 2) faster 1-layer loop instead of
                               multi-layer loop. 3) Easier allocate/deallocate arrays
                               3. Started using smart pointers instead of raw pointers in  order to avoid possible memory leak.
                               4. Removed datadistr(:) and ndistr from the map
                               5. Now the class of DataContainer provides 4 template functions to access the map:
                             	   1) read-only by value:         getKey_constRef
                             	   2) read-only by pointer:       getKey_constPtr
                             	   3) writable access by value:   getKey_Val
                             	   4) writable access by pointer: getKey_Ptr
                               6. Reorganized the code structure.
  - r08   chuan   2014Jan07    Re-config the code to have datacontainer and datamarshal loosely paired.
  - n/a   chuan   2014Jan10    1. Added new piece of code to read ibnum, ibgrd, iepsmp and idebmap from forSolver.dat without Lin's
                               surface construction class.
                               2. Fixed various bugs.
